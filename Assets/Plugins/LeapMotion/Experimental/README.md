# Experimental Modules

The maintainers of this repository do not officially support modules contained herein. We present these work-in-progress modules as-is to our developer community, with the understanding that they are early in their lifecycle.

We would be happy to consider PRs targeting items in this folder, but are unlikely to offer a significant amount of support if you encounter issues with these modules. (We may or may not ticket those issues, depending on how likely the experimental module is to become a real thing.)

The modules in this folder are going to change without warning and are very likely untested. They may not be easy to use, they may have little to no documentation, and they really aren't guaranteed to do anything except compile. (We don't like breaking compilation on `master` or `develop`, so they probably will compile.)

Also, things might disappear for no reason. Have fun! :D
