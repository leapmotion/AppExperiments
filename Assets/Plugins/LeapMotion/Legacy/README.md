# Legacy Modules

The modules contained herein are deprecated. They will compile, and we make an effort to continue supporting these modules in newer versions of Unity and our own assets as we perform upgrades and add new features. However, they are scheduled to be phased out and removed eventually. As a result, some example scenes may have broken references or otherwise be out-of-date.

## UIInput

The UIInput module is technically deprecated, but is still a good solution for using Leap hands with UGUI. While we recommend the Interaction Engine and first-class 3D interfaces for building UI, this may not be realistic for some projects. We have kept the example scenes for UIInput up-to-date and will fix issues as we upgrade e.g. to new Unity versions. However, we don't anticipate any new features being added to the UIInput module.
