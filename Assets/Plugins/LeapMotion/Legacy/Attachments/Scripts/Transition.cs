  * The Transition class animates the position, rotation, scale, and color of child game objects.
  * Use a Transition to animate hand attachments when they turn on or off. For example, you could
  * make an arm HUD rotate or fade into view when activated.
  *
  * The Transition component should be placed on an empty game object that is a child of one of the hand 
  * attachment transforms (i.e. for the palm, one of the fingers, etc.). The attached objects to be affected 
  * by the transition should be children of that empty game object.
  *
  * Assign the Transition component to the AttachmentController.Transition property. The AttachmentController 
  * will then call the Transition methods at the appropriate times.
  * 
  * The Transition component uses AnimationCurve objects to control the animation. The curves you use should cover a 
  * domain of -1 to 1. The portion of the curve from -1 to 0 is used for the "in" transition (off to on state); the portion
  * from 0 to 1 is used for the "out" transition (on to off state).
  *
  * You can use the Simulate slider in the Unity inspector to observe the affect of the transition in the editor.
