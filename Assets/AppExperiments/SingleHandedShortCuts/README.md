# AppExperiments - Shortcuts

Salvaged the one-handed shortcut menu from demo Shortcuts https://gallery.leapmotion.com/shortcuts/

## Notes

Currently only the 4 option translation rail with powerball is tested. The actions from demo (e.g. paper airplane and bow) scripts can be found in ActivityTesting directory but require some work and could be missing assets.

The helper script "ShortcutActions" on the root Leap Shortcuts Rig GameObject is meant to provide a simple place to trigger your own custom actions. However, the PowerBall scripts on each AttachmentHand > Palm have many more events for finer control.

Icons for the actions can be found near the bottom of PowerballAffordances (on same gameobject as Powerball).
